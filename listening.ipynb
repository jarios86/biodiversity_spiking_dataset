    "# Converting a audio dataset using a NAS \n",

    "This notebook is an example of how to convert a audio dataset using a NAS deployed on the NODE board using the OKEARTool. The OKAERTool is a Python package that provides a simple interface to interact with the OKAERTool board. The OKAERTool board is a low-cost, open-source hardware platform that can be used to deploy and test AER based systems on the edge.\n",

    "The choosen dataset is \"WABAD: A World Annotated Bird Acoustic Dataset for Passive Acoustic Monitoring\" (available: https://zenodo.org/records/14191524). It consists of several folders which contain both recordings and annotations. There is also a csv file describing the characteristics of every sound: folder, file, bird species, starting and ending time, highest and lowest frequency, country, continent and environment. "
